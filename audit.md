‚è∫ üö® CRITICAL SECURITY AUDIT RESULTS

  IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

  Your codebase has 3 CRITICAL and 5 HIGH severity vulnerabilities that need immediate attention:

  üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately):

  1. Exposed API Keys & Secrets

  - Your .env.local file contains production secrets
  - Notion, Resend, and MongoDB credentials are exposed
  - Risk: Complete compromise of all connected services

  2. Next.js Version Vulnerabilities

  - Using Next.js 14.2.4 with known security flaws
  - Authentication bypass and cache poisoning vulnerabilities
  - Risk: Application compromise

  3. Database Credentials Exposed

  - MongoDB connection string with embedded credentials
  - Risk: Complete database takeover

  üü† HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES:

  4. No Input Validation on API Routes

  - API endpoints accept unvalidated input
  - Risk: NoSQL injection attacks

  5. Rate Limiting Can Be Bypassed

  - Rate limiting fails completely if MongoDB is down
  - Risk: DoS attacks and abuse

  6. Error Messages Leak Internal Info

  - Detailed errors exposed in logs
  - Risk: Information disclosure

  üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED:

  Would you like me to:

  1. Fix the critical vulnerabilities right now?
  2. Update Next.js and dependencies?
  3. Add proper input validation to all API routes?
  4. Implement secure error handling?

  This application CANNOT be safely deployed in its current state. The exposed secrets alone are a critical risk.
  Should I start fixing these issues immediately?
